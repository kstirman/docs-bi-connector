The MongoDB Connector for Business Intelligence (BI) allows users to
visualize their MongoDB Enterprise data using existing relational
business intelligence tools such as Tableau.

These tools expect to connect to a data source and find data in tabular
form following a fixed schema. This presents a challenge when working
with MongoDB's :manual:`flexible schema </data-modeling>` and rich,
multi-dimensional, documents.

The |bi| acts as a layer that passes queries and
data between a :program:`mongod` or :program:`mongos` instance and your
reporting tool. It uses a foreign data wrapper with PostgreSQL to
provide a relational :term:`SQL` view into your MongoDB data.

Using this model, the |bi| components store no data,
and purely serve to bridge your MongoDB server with business
intelligence tools.
